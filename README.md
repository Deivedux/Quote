Title: Stop self-botting, quote messages the legal way

[TITLE]

If you always wanted to quote user messages without getting in trouble for it, then **Quote** is what you need.
Other than modifying your discord client, you can make a bot to do it for you without any issues.

## What messages are supported?
> • Normal message with content, sent either by a normal user or any different bot.

> • Embed's color depends on the message author's color in the server by roles.

> • Message containing an image as an attachment will also be quoted, but if there are more than 1 images in the message then only the first image will be quoted (discord's limitations).

> • Rich Embed messages will not be quoted, and there will never be plans to add support for them.
